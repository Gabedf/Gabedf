<h1>Hello, I'm Gabriel Fonseca!</h1>

<p>I am a dedicated programming student with a fascinating and enriching journey in the field.</p>

<h2>My Journey</h2>
<p>My interest in programming began during the pandemic in 2021, when I had my first contacts with programming logic and Python. At that time, I was focused on my Economics degree, but the pandemic made me reconsider my plans.</p>
<p>Even while pursuing Economics, I continued to explore programming gradually. Over time, I realized that my true passion was in technology. In 2022, I decided to redirect all my energy towards programming, leaving Economics behind.</p>
<p>In 2023, I was accepted into a Systems of Information course and am fully dedicated to learning and growing in this field. I am excited to apply my knowledge and explore new technologies!</p>

<h2>What I'm Doing Now</h2>
<p>Currently, I am pursuing a Systems of Information degree and seeking practical experiences to develop my skills. I am involved in personal projects and constantly striving to learn more about the technology field.</p>
